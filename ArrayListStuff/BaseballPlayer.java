/* 
Write a method called findTeamAverage that has one parameter: a BaseballPlayer array.
The method should return a double that is the teamâ€™s batting average. 
Compute the team average by dividing the total hits by the total at-bats. 
*Make sure a player exists before processing him. 
*Also, perform a check against zero before computing the team average. 
If the team total at-bats is 0, return a team batting average of 0.0. 
Finally, adapt your algorithm to work with an ArrayList of BaseballPlayer objects.
*/

/*Algorithm:
  1: Create a variable called totalHits and set it equal to 0
  2: Create a variable called totalAtBats and set it equal to 0
  3: Look at each player on the roster
  4: Get the number of hits for the player and add it to totalHits
  5: Get the number of atBats for the player and add it to totalAtBats
  6: Continue until you reach the end of the list
  7: Compute the teamBattingAverage by dividing the totalHits by the totalAtBats
  8: Return the teamBattingAverage
